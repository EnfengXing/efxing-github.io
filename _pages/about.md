Hi! I'm Mike, an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics and Operations at the [University of Pittsburgh Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business](https://www.katz.business.pitt.edu/). I am broadly interested in problems related to pricing, analytics, and their algorithmic aspects.

I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University in the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) and my B.S. at [Rutgers University in Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/).
