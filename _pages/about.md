Hi! I'm Mike, an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics and Operations at the [University of Pittsburgh Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business](https://www.katz.business.pitt.edu/). I am broadly interested in problems related to pricing, analytics, and their algorithmic aspects.

I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University in the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) where I was advised by Adam N. Elachtoub. Before that, I earned B.S. from Rutgers University in [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/).

For more details please see my [CV](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/files/Resume_CV.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kJjuGMgAAAAJ&hl=en), and list of [papers](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/publications/) .

[Interested in working with me?](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/talks/)
