Hi! I'm Mike, I'm an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics and Operations at the [University of Pittsburgh Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business](https://www.katz.business.pitt.edu/), and a affiliated member of the Center for Analytical Approaches to Social Innovation [(CAASI)](https://www.caasi.pitt.edu/). I am broadly interested in problems related to pricing, prescriptive analytics, and market design.

I received my Ph.D. from Columbia University in [Operations Research](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) where I was advised by [Adam N. Elmachtoub](http://www.columbia.edu/~ae2516/). Before that, I earned a B.Sc. from Rutgers University in [Mathematics](https://www.math.rutgers.edu/). For more details please see my [CV](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/files/Resume_CV.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kJjuGMgAAAAJ&hl=en), and/or list of [Papers](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/publications/).

I am always on the lookout for interesting problems, strong students, and new collaborators. [Are you interested in working with me? Click here!](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/collaboration/)
