* *Industry Collaborators*
  * I am eager to connect with new industry collaborators, especially those in the greater Pittsburgh community. Even small Ph.D. trained industrial research/data science teams cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in salary plus associated costs, academic collaboration with people like myself and my students can provide the same level of cutting edge analysis and innovation at no financial cost while advancing the common good. If you have an interesting problem please send me an email to set-up a meeting!

* *Academic Collaborators*
  * I'm actively taking on more projects. If you have an interesting problem that intersects with some of my work, or are looking for a new problem please reach out over email and we can set-up a Zoom call.
  
* *Prospective Students*
  * If you’re a prospective Ph.D. candidate, consider applying to our [Ph.D. program in Business Analytics and Operations](https://business.pitt.edu/phd/phd-in-business-analytics-and-operations/). Please specify in your application (specifically in the personal statement!) that you are interested in working with me. For more information about the program I'm happy to chat about it over email as well.


  * If you’re an existing Ph.D. student and want to collaborate on a project, please:
    * Take a look at some of my research papers.
    * Email me so we can talk about your research so far, and what kinds of problems you want to collaborate on.

  * If you’re a Undergraduate/Master's student (especially a student interested in advancing on to Ph.D. in Operations Research or a similar field!) and want to collaborate on a project, please send me an email describing:
    * Your relevant coursework.
    * Why you want to do a research project 
    * What kinds of problems interest you.
