## BUSQOM 1080 Materials

My data analysis course serves as the first introduction to R, and data analysis using R, for upper level business undergraduates at the University of Pittsburgh. It covers a variety of basic statistical methods and their implementations in R. For a complete list of topics please my [Fall '20 Syllabus](https://mhamilton-pitt.github.io/files/Syllabus.pdf). 

In the table below I've collected all of my Powerpoint Slides, associated R Notebooks, and Datasets for my course (second half coming soon!). I hope that they will serve as an instructive reference, please don't hesistate to email me if you have comments, questions, or corrections.
